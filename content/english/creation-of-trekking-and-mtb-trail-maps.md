The **creation of trekking and MTB trail maps** is an activity that combines technical skills and graphic creativity. It is not just about drawing lines on a chart, but about transforming a route into a clear, readable and attractive representation for the end user.  
A well-designed map helps visitors orient themselves, provides practical information and conveys the care and professionalism of the tourist destination.  



## Transfer of gpx tracks onto the map

Today most routes are recorded with GPS systems. Thanks to **GPX** files, it is possible to import hiking trails or MTB routes directly onto the map.  
The advantage is twofold:  
- Millimetric precision in the representation of tracks  
- Possibility to add **waypoints** and **points of interest (POI)** such as shelters, springs, picnic areas or natural attractions  

This integration makes the map a dynamic tool, easily updatable and usable both in digital and printed formats.  



## Foldable maps and tourist flyers

**Foldable maps** are still a paper support highly appreciated by tourists. Portable, practical and visually impactful, they can be distributed at:  
- tourist offices  
- campsites and holiday villages  
- hotels and resorts  
- sporting events and MTB or trail running races  

A **flyer with an integrated map** thus becomes both a guide for visitors and a promotional tool for the tourist destination. The combination of clear graphics, bright colors and informative content turns the map into a real marketing tool.  



## Why a good map is tourism marketing

A **map carefully designed in detail** is not only a support for orientation, but also a message that tells the identity of the territory. Some advantages of a quality map:  

- **Attracts tourists**: colors and design make the territory more appealing  
- **Communicates professionalism**: a tourist office offering a good map conveys reliability and attention  
- **Facilitates sharing**: maps, especially if integrated with QR codes and digital resources, become content easily shared on social media  
- **Increases perceived value**: the tourist feels welcomed and guided in discovering the area  



## Integration between digital and paper maps

The creation of modern maps allows for a dual version:  
- **Printed**, as a foldable leaflet, flyer or information panel  
- **Digital**, viewable on smartphones, with QR codes linking directly to GPX tracks or interactive online maps  

This synergy ensures tourists a complete experience, combining tradition and innovation.  



## Conclusion

Creating trekking and MTB trail maps means enhancing the territory and offering tourists a useful tool that is beautiful to look at and easy to use. A well-designed map becomes an integral part of the tourism marketing strategy, improving the destination’s visibility and making the visitor’s experience more engaging.
