My name is Graziano De Maio and for years I have been dedicated to creating maps for tourism, mountain bike trails, trekking, trail running, and territorial representation. My passion for maps began very early in my life. As a child, I used to spend hours browsing through an old De Agostini geographic atlas (I still have it, itâ€™s from 1977) which still contains many countries that no longer exist today!  

My passion for maps probably comes from an unconscious (and also conscious) desire to travel.  

My passion for mountain bike hiking has over time led me to become an expert in GPS track plotting with various systems, and in the ability to beautifully represent them on paper maps or digital maps.
