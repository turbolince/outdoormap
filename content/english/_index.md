  title: "Creation of maps and charts for territory and tourism"
  content: "Maps and charts are still widely used today and remain truly fascinating. The creation of tourist maps and charts is our passion. We specialize in designing maps and charts for parks and nature reserves. Our 2D and 3D maps are perfect for illustrating trails, routes and itineraries of tourist destinations. Some examples of use: maps and charts for MTB and trekking routes. Maps and charts for running and trail running races. We create maps by accurately placing GPX tracks on the map with waypoints and POIs (points of interest). We design stunning illustrated 2D and 3D maps. We also produce folding maps for trails and routes. Maps for cycling and MTB races, trekking routes, camping areas and resorts, bike parks and ski resorts. Our specialty is creating maps for parks and nature reserves."

  - title: "How do we create maps?"
    image: "/images/map-vintage-treasure-hunt-small.jpg"

    content: "Maps are created starting from a style based on their use and destination. The cartographic base depends on the project. For a vintage-style map we use desaturated maps with contour lines and vintage illustrations. If the chart is modern, we use colored and shaded Opentopo bases. The map elements, the legend, and the distribution of elements differ for each project. Once the map style has been decided, we define the size, folding options and start creating the content. If trails and itineraries need to be illustrated, the client can provide GPX files that are precisely mapped with colors, labels and references."

  - title: "Creation of 3D maps"
    image: "/images/mappe-3d-2d-turismo.jpg"
    content: "Our maps are of two types: maps with satellite texture and real highmap relief, or illustrated vector maps. In both cases we enrich the maps with graphic elements, information and photos. The big difference between the two map types lies in the type of territory to be represented and the resolution required. For maps to be printed on large panels, illustrated vectors should be used, while for the web, social media and small prints, satellite textures can be used, as long as the territory is well represented. Our 'infographic' maps are also ideal for generating viral content for social networks."

    content: "The charm of foldable maps is timeless. Combining the effectiveness of modern maps with the beauty of a paper map is still a great effect today. We design maps and charts for park trails and nature reserves. We map GPX tracks and waypoints onto the maps, with the option to connect directly to online resources via QR codes."

  #   content: "The main purpose of Redline can be summarized in the goal of getting kids dirty with dust and mud, letting them ford a stream and maybe get their feet wet, and helping each other when the climb is too tiring.
    
  #    For us, seeing kids sitting in a meadow eating a sandwich and laughing means we've hit the target.

  #    We encourage healthy relationships among kids, showing them that helping each other is better than making fun of each other, showing them how nice it is to show respect and make peace when misunderstandings arise.
  #    All this finds its perfect setting in the context of woods and green meadows where, by our very nature, we are led to find our best balance."
